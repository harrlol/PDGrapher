Mutated genes in this cancer type: {'TP53'}

Comparing recall of recovering targets of approved drugs not in training set vs random
K: [1, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000]
Recall (Approved): [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6]
Recall (Random): [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

Comparing recall of recovering targets of approved drugs not in training set vs random (additionally, only considering the targets that are not in the training set!)
Not possible because there are no targets of approved drugs that are not in training set (all targets of approved drugs are in training set)

Comparing recall of recovering targets perturbed in the dataset which are not targets of approved drugs in training set vs random
K: [1, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000]
Recall (Perturbed not approved): [0.0011, 0.0112, 0.0179, 0.0258, 0.0404, 0.0628, 0.1031, 0.1379, 0.1693, 0.1951, 0.3004]
Recall (Random): [0.0, 0.0, 0.0011, 0.0011, 0.0022, 0.0034, 0.0146, 0.028, 0.0415, 0.0471, 0.0874]
